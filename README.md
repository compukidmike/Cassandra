# Assembly Instructions

**All parts go on the back side of the PCB!**

There's an extra LED and resistor in the kit because we know that sometimes things happen.

**Step 1:** Align the flex PCB on the back of the main PCB. There are round pads that correspond to holes in the flex PCB. If they don't quite line up, try flipping the flex PCB over. Solder each hole to its pad to hold the PCBs together.

**Step 2:** Solder the 3 LEDs. They should face towards the center of the PCB. There is a little notch on one side of the LED. It should be facing towards the outside of the PCB. *NOTE: The top LED straddles one of the flex PCB solder joints. Use care to avoid solder bridges!*

**Step 3:** Solder the 3 resistors.

**Step 4:** Solder the SAO header. The notch should go towards the top of the PCB (Follow the silkscreen on the PCB).

**Step 5:** Moisturise!*

*Putting actual moisturiser on your SAO is not recommended and will void the warranty **

**There is no warranty. You're on your own.
